## Lab - Build custom image with our application binary and push the image to JFrog Artifactory Docker Registry

Openshift need to login to JFrog Artifactry server in order to push the custom docker images, hence let's create a secret to store the JFrog Login Credentials in Openshift
```
oc create secret docker-registry private-jfrog-image-registry --docker-server=https://<your-jfrog-id>.jfrog.io --docker-username=<your-jfrog-registered-email> --docker-password=<your-jfrog-token>
secret/private-jfrog-image-registry created
```

Expected output

We need to create a buildconfig along with the jfrog credentials in the form of pushsecret as shown below

## Lab - Deploying hello microservice using our custom docker image from Private JFrog Docker Registry
```
cd ~/openshift-june-2024
git pull
cd Day5/buildconfig
oc create deployment hello --image=tektutorjegan74.jfrog.io/jegan-docker/hello-spring-microservice:1.0 --replicas=3 -o yaml --dry-run=client

oc create deployment hello --image=tektutorjegan74.jfrog.io/jegan-docker/hello-spring-microservice:1.0 --replicas=3 -o yaml --dry-run=client  > hello-deploy.yml
```

Update the hello-deploy to use your private-jfrog-image-registry secret as JFrog Artifactory will allow only authorized users to download and use the image from it.
```
cd ~/openshift-june-2024
git pull
cd Day5/buildconfig
cat hello-deploy.yml
oc apply -f hello-deploy.yml
oc get deploy,po
oc get po -w
oc get po
```

Expected output

Let's create an internal service for hello microservice
```
oc expose deploy/hello --type=ClusterIP --port=8080 -o yaml --dry-run=client
oc expose deploy/hello --type=ClusterIP --port=8080 -o yaml --dry-run=client > hello-svc.yml
oc apply -f hello-svc.yml
oc get svc
oc describe svc/hello
```

Expected output
![image](https://github.com/tektutor/openshift-june-2024/assets/12674043/f479b8ff-1c00-41ba-8c56-f7229aa7b2f5)

Let's create a route to access the hello microservice from outside the openshift cluster
```
oc expose svc/hello -o yaml --dry-run=client
oc expose svc/hello -o yaml --dry-run=client > hello-route.yml

cat hello-route.yml

oc apply -f hello-route.yml
oc get route
oc describe route/hello
```
Expected output

## Lab - Rolling update - updating hello microservice to its v2.0
When the build config file is updated, we need to apply the changes in the openshift cluster
```
cd ~/openshift-june-2024
git pull
cd Day5/buildconfig
cat buildconfig-pushto-artifactory.yml
oc apply -f buildconfig-pushto-artifactory.yml
oc get buildconfigs
oc start-build bc/hello
```
Once the new image v2.0 is pushed successfully to JFrog Artifactory, you can proceed as shown bellow

```
oc set image deploy/hello hello=tektutorjegan74.jfrog.io/jegan-docker/hello-spring-microservice:2.0
oc get deploy/hello -o yaml | grep image
oc get route
curl http://hello-jegan.apps.ocp4.tektutor.org.labs
```

Expected output

## Info - What is Continuous Integration?
<pre>
- Jenkins - is a CI Build Server
- We can create a Jenkins Job - to monitor code commits done in GitHub/BitBucket or any version control
- Whenever Jenkins detects code commit in the version control, it will start the build
- As part of the CI Build, it will first clone the latest source code from GitHub/BitBucket code repository
- Then it will start the application build (maven build, dotnet build)
- As part of the build, you also have to have some automated test cases which runs part of the build
- If any test cases fails, the build will also fail
- If code is compiling and all test cases are executed successfully then the build will succeed.
</pre>

## Info - What is Continuous Deployment?
<pre>
- the dev team certified CI builds, will automatically deploy the application binaries into QA environment for further automated testing
- if all the automated test cases added by QA team succeeds then the build is good to go live in production
- it might require some manual approvals
</pre>

## Info - What is Continuous Delivery?
<pre>
- the QA certified build will automatically be deployed into pre-prod environment for the customer to check and approve to decide to make them live in production  
</pre>

## Info - What is a Jenkins CI/CD Job?
<pre>
- could build application source and run automated test cases
- could build custom docker images
- could deploy application binaries to JFrog, Weblogic or JBoss
- could deploy application into Openshift
</pre>  

## Info - What is Jenkins Pipeline?
<pre>
- Pipelines involves many Jenkins Job that run one after the other in sequence or in parallel
- Pipelines consists of many Stages
- Each Stage will have one Jenkins Job
- When the First Stage Job succeeds it will trigger next downstream jenkins job in the pipeline
- If the second stage Job succeeds it will trigger the next downstream jenkins job in the pipeline
- this goes on until all the jobs complete successfully
- if any one of the stage fails, it won't trigger the next downstream jenkins job and the build will fail
</pre>
